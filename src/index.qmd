## Welcome {-}

We are so glad that you found us! We are here to be a training resource to the [Juniata Valley Council](https://www.jvcscouting.org/) Scouters. In these pages, you can find information on:

- Why does training matter?
- What is Required Training?
- In Person Training Offerings
- and more!

Further resources are available at the [National Scouting America Training](https://www.scouting.org/training/) website.

The training newsletter will be sent to all registered scouters. Please add 
`juniatavalleycouncil@247scouting.com` to your safe senders list so you can receive this and other upcoming events in the Juniata Valley Council.
